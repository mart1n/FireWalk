=== FireWalk ===

A simple backdoor with the goal of circumventing network firewalls.


The daemon process, fwalk.c, runs on the system that you're wanting to backdoor.
It processes all incomming ICMP packets, looking for a password, ip address and
port number in the payload. If the password matches, it establishes a TCP connection
with the IP adress and port number specified and lanuches a root shell.

You can craft the ICMP packet any way you like to initiate the connection. I've included
a tool, summon.c, that you can use. It defaults to ICMP type 3, code 0, but can easily be
changed to find an ICMP type that is not filtered by the backdoored system's firewall.

One easy way to catch the connect-back with our root shell, is to use netcat. You can
use netcat to listen on a specified port. e.g. /usr/bin/nc -l -p 31337

=== Setup ===

Make sure to edit the password in fwalk.c


=== TODO ===

* Add client command line options for icmp type and code.
* Add client mode that brute foces and tries all ICMP types/codes.
